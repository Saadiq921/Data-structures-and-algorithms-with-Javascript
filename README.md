# Data structures and algorithms with Javascript 🗄 🗃 🗂

## Linear Data structures
In linear data structures, which means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed.
- Arrays 🗂 🗄
- Linked Lists 🖇 🔗
- Queues 🏦  🚶🚶‍♀️🚶🚶🏿‍♂️👩🏿‍🦯🧑🏿‍🦼
- Stacks 🏯📚
- Sets 🧮
- Maps  🌍🌏

## Non-linear Data structures
In non-linear data structures, items don’t have to be arranged in order, which means that we could traverse the data structure non-sequentially.
- Trees 🌴🎄
- Graphs 📊📉

#### Array 🗂 🗄
An array is a collection of similar data elements stored at contiguous memory locations. It is the simplest data structure where each data element can be accessed directly by only using its index number. Arrays in Javascript are built-in.
#### Linked List  💾 ⛓ 🔗
A linked list is a collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next.
#### Queue 🏦  🚶‍🚶🏿‍♂️👩🏿‍🦯 🚶🧑🏿‍🦼🚶‍♀️
A queue data structure is a linear data structure that follows a FIFO(First In First Out) model, a real life representation would be a line(linear) in a grocery shop , whoever comes first is the first to be checked out.
#### Stack 🏯📚
A stack data structute is also a linear data structute, but it follows a LIFO(Last In First Out) model, a real life representation would be a stack of plates, one couldn't get access to the last plate at the bottom without removing the plates on top.
#### Tree 🌲🌳
A tree is a hierarchical data structure defined as a collection of nodes. Nodes represent value and nodes are connected by edges. A tree has the following properties: The tree has one node called root. The tree originates from this, and hence it does not have any parent.
#### Graph 📈📊
Graphs are non-linear data structures made up of a finite number of nodes or vertices and the edges that connect them. Graphs are used to address real-world problems in which it represents the problem area as a network like telephone networks, circuit networks, and social networks.
#### Set  🧮
A Set object is a collection of values. A value in the Set may only occur once; it is unique in the Set's collection. You can iterate through the elements of a set in insertion order. Unlike other data structures(Linked List, Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph) with the exception of maps, Javascript has Sets built in.
#### Map  🌍🌏
A Map holds key-value pairs where the keys can be any datatype. It remembers the original insertion order of the keys. Unlike other data structures(Linked List, Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph) with the exception of Sets, Javascript has Maps built in.
